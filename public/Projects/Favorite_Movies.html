    <h2>My Best Favorites of all Time.</h2>
    <hr/>

    <h3>1. RRR <i>(Indian Movie)</i></h3>
    <p>This Movie is about 2 Friends with different background who grew to respect each other and worked together for a common goal of liberating the masses. I rate it <bold>5 Star!</bold></p>

    <h3>2. Arhemy of Souls <i>(Korean Movie)</i></h3>
    <p>Ranked best amongst the season movies I have watched. A story of an assasin who fell in love with a prince who was neglected to be protected!</p>

    <h3>3. Terminator 2 <i>(American Movie)</i></h3>
    <p>Purely Action and Sci-fi! Meet the eye with good action scene.</p>
